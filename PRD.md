### 4.7 The Break Scheduling Algorithm

#### Core Algorithm Logic

```
FUNCTION suggestBreaks(userCalendar, userPreferences, historicalData):
    
    // Step 1: Define work boundaries
    workdayStart = firstMeeting - 1 hour OR userPreference OR 9 AM
    workdayEnd = lastMeeting + 30 min OR userPreference OR 6 PM
    
    // Step 2: Analyze meeting density
    FOR each meeting in calendar:
        meetingIntensity = calculateIntensity(duration, attendeeCount, title)
        meetingType = classifyMeeting(title, recurring, attendees)
    
    // Step 3: Find break opportunities
    opportunities = []
    FOR each gap between meetings:
        IF gap >= 15 minutes:
            score = calculateOpportunityScore(
                gapDuration,
                timeSinceLastBreak,
                upcomingMeetingIntensity,
                userHistoricalAcceptance,
                timeOfDay
            )
            opportunities.add({time: gapStart, score: score})
    
    // Step 4: Select optimal breaks
    selectedBreaks = opportunities.sortByScore().take(3)
    
    // Step 5: Match break types
    FOR each selectedBreak:
        breakType = selectBreakType(
            precedingMeetingContext,
            timeOfDay,
            userPreferences,
            recentBreakHistory
        )
        selectedBreak.type = breakType
    
    RETURN selectedBreaks
```

#### Contextual Intelligence

**Meeting Analysis Keywords**:
- High-stress indicators: "review", "deadline", "urgent", "presentation"
- Creative indicators: "brainstorm", "ideation", "design", "planning"
- Social indicators: "1:1", "team", "all-hands", "standup"
- Deep work indicators: "blocked", "focus time", "deep work"

**Break Matching Logic**:
- Post-stress meeting → Calming meditation or breathing
- Pre-presentation → Confidence boosting or energizing
- Post-creative session → Physical movement to reset
- Mid-afternoon slump → Energizing music or movement
- Before deep work → Focus-enhancing mindfulness

#### Adaptive Learning
- Track acceptance rate by time of day
- Learn preferred break durations
- Identify pattern exceptions (e.g., no breaks on Fridays)
- Adjust to schedule changes over time
